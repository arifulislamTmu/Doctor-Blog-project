                <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;">
                  When the big toe begins leaning more and more outwards, 
                  crowding the smaller toes on your foot, it can cause many problems. The smaller
                  toes may begin crossing over or under the big toe, resulting in difficulty in shoe wear and
                  ulceration of the toes due to rubbing. You may also experience pain after longer walks or
                  often even at the start of the day, restricting your flexibility and mobility in your daily activities. 
                </p>

                <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;">
                  I specialise in the gentle treatment of misalignment of the big toe with minimally 
                  invasive procedures on the forefoot. The goal of hallux valgus treatment being to help you
                  regain your mobility as quickly as possible and experience permanent medical and cosmetic 
                  improvement of your hallux valgus. The more severe the deformity, the more complex the surgery will be.
                  That is a reason to see a specialist, for gentle options to correct hallux valgus early.
                </p>
                <h4>What causes the pain?</h4>
                <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;">The bunion itself can become inflamed and push against the inside of the shoe. 
                  The smaller toes next to the big toe can become deformed, rubbing on shoes or catching on 
                  objects causing pain. The arch of the foot can become painful as the normal tripod balance within the
                   frame of the foot is disrupted. Lastly, the deformity, 
                  degenerative and progressive in nature can lead to arthritis, which can cause pain.</p>
                  
              <h4>When does hallux valgus need surgery?</h4>
                <img src="info/Hallux Valgus 02.jpg" style="float: left;" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;">
                  Bunions cannot be corrected by changing shoes, using insoles or foot exercises. Although insoles
                  may provide relief for painful hallux valgus, they do not correct the misalignment.
                  Hallux valgus is often a cosmetic problem for many female patients - especially in open-toed shoes,
                  requiring correction. Another reason for surgery, is pain. Surgery normally includes the following 
                  procedures: An osteotomy (repositioning of the big toe in a straight position), removal of the offending 
                  bony bump, as well as tight soft tissue release and tendon correction, all via small, neat surgical incisions.
                  In addition to straightening the big toe, the goal of treating bunions surgically in early stages,
                  is to preserve the joints at risk of developing arthritis.
                  This allows us to  restore the balance of the foot and  the quality of life of our patients.

                <h4  style="  color: #1B405A;">What is the success rate of bunion surgery?</h4>
                <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;">
                  The potential benefits and complications of bunion surgery must always be
                   weighed up carefully. In international studies on this issue, about 80% of patients 
                   felt very well following surgery. Another 10–15% felt better than before surgery, even 
                   if they still had minor problems. Only about
                   5% of all the patients in the studies experienced no improvement from bunion surgery. 
                </p>

                <h4>FAQ: Frequently asked questions about hallux valgus surgery</h4>
                <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;"><h6> How long does hallux valgus surgery take to heal? </h6>
                 Healing is complete after four to six
                   weeks. Incapacity for work, however, 
                  also depends on your job: A standing job requires more time off than a sitting job.
                </p>

                <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;"><h5>Can I walk after hallux valgus surgery? </h5>
                  Using a forefoot decompression shoe you can
                   walk immediately following surgery. 
                  This forefoot decompression shoe prevents the foot from rolling off across the big toe.
                </p>
                
                <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;"><h5>  Is the foot immobilised following surgery? </h5>
                    The foot is not put in a cast or 
                    immobilised following hallux surgery.
                    The big toe also remains passively flexible.
                </p>
                <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;"><h5> When can I return to wearing regular shoes? </h5>
                    Even after completing follow-up
                    treatment with the forefoot decompression shoe you should wear soft, 
                    comfortable and wide shoes for another four to six weeks.

                <h3  style="  color: #1B405A;">Application of PRP Therapy for Injuries</h3>
                <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;">
                <h5>  What is PRP?</h5>
                    Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) involves taking a small sample of blood and spinning it in a
                    centrifuge to concentrate and separate the platelets and plasma from the other components
                    (red blood cells) of your blood.
                    This concentrated solution is then injected back into the body at the injury site.
                </p>

   
                <p class="text_description" style="color: #1B405A;">
                  <h5> WHY does it work?</h5>
                  <img src="info/PRP knee.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    Platelets are the part of the blood that contain growth factors and proteins. 
                    These are very important in the repair and regeneration of damaged tissue. PRP
                    Therapy works by accelerating the body’s own healing process, by adding a
                    concentrated solution of these healing growth factors to the damaged tissue. 
                    They address the injury site by encouraging the growth of new, healthy cells.
                  </p>


                  <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;">
                    <h5> What injuries can PRP be used for?</h5>
                    PRP can be used to effectively treat many ailments or injuries. 
                    Weakened ligaments and tendons, cause the majority of the pain 
                    and damage related to joints. But many patients with degenerative or arthritic joints
                     have also had significant relief with a course of PRP therapy.
                     Some of the most common injuries that have benefitted from PRP Therapy are:

                     <li>Osteoarthritis of the major joints (knee, shoulder, hip, and spine)</li>
                     <li>Rotator cuff strains and tears</li>
                     <li>Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries</li>
                     <li>Pelvic pain and instability</li>
                     <li>Back and neck injuries or pain</li>
                     <li>Tendonosis (Tennis Elbow)</li>
                     <li>Tendonitis and ligament sprains</li>
                     <li>Chronic knee pain (arthritis or injury)</li>
                     <li>Muscle strains</li>
                     Our plasma treatments strengthen these weak tissues, leading to improved joint and muscle functions with significantly less pain.
                  </p>

                      <h5> The PRP Process.</h5>
                      <img style="float: left;" src="info/PRP process.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                      Depending on your particular injury, one to multiple sessions of platelet-rich 
                      plasma may be required. Each patient is unique, we work with you to create 
                      an ideal plan for you to provide the best chance of a successful outcome.
                   </p>

                   <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;">
                    <h5>Before your PRP session:</h5>
                  
                    It is helpful to remember that there are a few things to take into consideration before your session:
                   <li> At least three to four days before your procedure, discontinue anti-inflammatory medications (Celebrex, arcoxia, brufen for example)</li>
                   <li> One to two weeks before your procedure, discontinue any blood thinning herbs, supplements, or vitamins </li>
                   <li> One to two weeks before your procedure, discontinue systemic steroids</li>
                   <li> At least one month before your procedure, discontinue steroid injections</li>
                   <li> On the day of your procedure, eat a full, healthy breakfast and be sure to drink plenty of water</li>
                   
                    Please be advised that if you take chronic oral steroids, a discontinuation plan will need to be discussed with your primary care provider as abrupt stoppage may cause side effects. 
                    Please let us know if you are on any chronic medication so we can check if its safe to stop.
                 </p>

                 <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;">
                  <h5> After your PRP session:</h5>
                  After your PRP Therapy session, we recommend that all patients rest on the day of their procedure.
                   For the next 2 days, we advise limited use of the injection area, but movement is encouraged. 
                  This helps the joint recover as the injection is absorbed by the area’s surrounding tissues.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <h5> 0 – 3 days post-procedure guidelines.</h5>
                  After your treatment, there is a chance you’ll experience some mild to moderate pain or discomfort at the injection site. This is normal, and it is a sign that your body is healing as it adjusts to the injection. It is best to stay hydrated and drink plenty of water to help promote healing.
                  It is critical that you DO NOT take ANY medications following your procedure unless specifically directed otherwise by a physician. This is because any medication can affect the healing process or other adverse effects.
               </p>

                
                <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;">
                  <h5>Therefore, discontinue use of any of these medications post-procedure for best results:</h5>
                   <li>Anti-inflammatory medications for at least 2 weeks post-procedure</li>
                   <li>Blood-thinning herbs, supplements, or vitamins for 3-4 days post-procedure</li>
                   <li>Systematic steroids for 2 weeks post-procedure</li>
                </p>
              
                <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;">
                  <h5>Other important guidelines to follow after your PRP procedure are:</h5>
                   <li>Avoid applying ice or heat to the injection site for the first 72 hours post-procedure</li>
                   <li>Don’t take a very hot bath or go to a sauna for the first few days post-procedure</li>
                   <li>Avoid consumption of any alcoholic beverages for the first week post-procedure</li>
                   <li>Avoid showering for the first 24 hours following your procedure</li>
                   <li>Limit caffeine consumption for the first week post-procedure</li>
                   <li>Avoid smoking </li>
                </p>

                <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;">
                  <h5>3 – 14 days post-PRP</h5>
                  At this point in your healing, you should gradually increase your daily activities. This is also when you can begin exercises. Proper exercise is a vital part of long-term results, and we can help you determine which exercises are best suited for your needs prior to your procedure.
                <li>  Ice can be applied 3-4 times a day for 15-20 minutes as needed for comfort</li>
                 <li>
                  Anti-inflammatory medications (such as Tylenol) can be taken to help manage any residual pain at this time, take as directed
                  </li> 
                  <li> Continue to avoid alcoholic beverages, smoking, or excessive amounts of caffeine</li>
                 
                </p>
                
            
                <p class="text_description" style="  color: #1B405A;">
                  <h5> 3 – 4 weeks post-PRP:</h5>
                  At this point in your healing, we highly encourage you to begin physical therapy
                  to aid in your long-term healing and continued recovery. A follow-up appointment will be made 
                  to review your healing process. It is important that you keep this follow up visit even if your
                   recovery is going well. If there are any adjustments 
                 to your customized treatment plan, this is when we will be able to make those decisions.
