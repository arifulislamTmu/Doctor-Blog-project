            As Leonardo da Vinci said “The human foot is a masterpiece of engineering and

           I believe, having children has definitely helped me become a better doctor.
           I view the children in my practice as an extension of my family
           and will care for them the same kindness that I would care for my own

                            <p>From my first dealings with Dr Troisi, I’ve felt that I was in good hands.
                               Her expertise in diagnosis was evident, pre-op instructions were clear. 
                               For my actual surgery, I was made to feel at ease, and was informed of everything that was going on.
                                The entire process has been handled with precision and efficiency, 
                               but at the same time has been one filled with care. Thank you!
