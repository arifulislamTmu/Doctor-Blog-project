              A bunion occurs when  the big toe starts 
              drifting across towards the little toe. This causes a painful bump on the inner aspect
               of the foot and can also result in the small toes starting to tuck in or over the big toe to 
               compensate for loss of space. Mild deformity can be managed with splinting for shoe wear comfort, 
               but this will not correct the condition. Most cases will require surgery to put the bone back into the
                correct position.
               This takes away the painful bump and results in a straight, functional toe.

            <p class="  text_description">
               Sometimes the smaller toes can also degenerate and
               become misshapen. This results in a claw toe or hammer toe, which causes painful rubbing, 
               ulceration and callosities. This also makes shoe wear difficult, as the toe keeps catching on the 
               shoe on entry. Lesser to deformities are often corrected with fusion (joining together) of the bones of 
               the affected joint,

              Turf toe is a condition that can occur gradually
              over time or suddenly from an acute injury. Swelling, pain and tenderness 
              at the ball of the foot or metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe are classic symptoms.
              An athlete may complain of pain when pivoting, pushing off or cutting. Mild injury can usually be 
              managed conservatively,
              but the more severe injury may require surgery and repair of the torn/ fractures structures beneath
              the big toe.

            <p class="  text_description">
            An osteochondral lesion is  when there is trauma to the cartilage surface of the ankle joint. Although bone heals very well, cartilage is not quite as forgiving and may result in pain, and loose fragments within the joint. This lesion can be diagnosed by a scan (such  as a MRI) or arthroscopically. Treatment of such a lesion usually involves an arthroscopic debridement (keyhole surgery with a camera in the joint) where any loose fragments are removed and then microfracture, where instruments are used to stimulate the underlying exposed bone to form scar tissue and heal the surface. Following this type of surgery,
             patients are usually kept off their feet for a while in order to allow healing to take place.

            ankle instability is  usually a result of ligament/tendon failure. It results in pain, impingement, and frequent sprains or twisting of the ankle joint. If neglected, instability can result in abnormal loading of the joint and arthritis. If the ligament tear has occurred recently, there is potential for repair of the torn ligament. Should it be chronic or have occurred over some time, it is usually necessary to reconstruct the ligament. This entails using one of the body’s own tendons as a graft, using donor graft or using synthetic materials to reconstruct and stabilize the affected joint.

Chronic or long standing achilles ruptures are more difficult to manage than that newly torn ones. Surgery usually involves transfer of one of the adjacent tendons to take over the function of the old shortened tendon or lengthening of the shortened Achilles tendon.

Most cases of Achilles tendinitis can be treated with relatively simple, at home care under your doctors supervision. More serious cases of Achilles tendinitis can lead to tendon tears (ruptures) that may require surgical repair.

              <p class="  text_description">
              Tarsal tunnel syndrome usually develops as a result of prior  ankle injury. All other causes of tarsal tunnel syndrome may include flat feet, bony outgrowths in the tarsal tunnel, varicose veins, inflammation from arthritis, diabetes and trauma. Symptoms may include burning pain at the sole of the foot that’s worse when standing during activity. Other symptoms include numbness or tingling at the base of the foot. If tarsal Sumner syndrome is left untreated, it can result in permanent and irreversible nerve damage. Treatments can range from conservatives such as anti-inflammatory medication based ice compression and elevation. In severe cases it is recommended to have surgery, which includes the release of the ligament compressing the nerve within the tarsal tunnel. This can be done in an open fashion by arthroscopic surgery.

              <p class="  text_description">
                Following foot and ankle surgery your rehabilitation will be facilitated by our competent team of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and orthotists. The nature of your surgery will determine the degree of weight-bearing allowed post operatively. In cases where no weight can be placed on the limb for a period of time you will be provided with an assistive device and aided by physiotherapy so that you can mobilise safely.

                There are certain procedures which can be done using minimally invasive surgery. Should this option be available for your condition it will be discussed with you during the consultation.

              Arthroscopic surgery involves the insertion of the camera into the ankle joint through  a small 5 mm incision. A second incision will be made in order to allow for instrument insertion. Surgery can then be performed through these two portals, within the ankle joint. When operating on the back of the ankle to similar incisions will be made on either side of the Achilles tendon.
